# Random-Password-Generator

Added variables
Added declarations and "if" statements per criteria
Started to add values into total function
Prompts currently working with testing, result is undefined
Need to find way to not allow bypass of password length prompt
Need to fix "undefined" once all criteria selected

---

Alternative fix to force password length - forces user to refresh page
Same thing if no criteria selected --need to find way to keep prompting
Code is now returning 1 character after generate password selected
Need to find way to display entire code
Can see entire code is working properly until the very end during for-loop where only 1 character is displayed
